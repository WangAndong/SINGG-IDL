STANDALONES

This directory contains all the stand-alone or one-shot IDL programs used.  Some of these are testing algorithms, some are patches for known flaws, and some are just screwy.

convert_db.pro          Utility patch.  Converts a Linux-specific database
                          format to the IEEE standard.  Not needed if the DB
                          was created with the /EXTERNAL format, which all
                          SINGG routines now use.
convert_ellipse.pro     Utility patch.  Converts the old style of ellipse file
                          (P,A,B,C,G,Z) to the new style (D,P,pa,a,b)
donut.pro		Stand-alone program, giving annular fluxes for various
                          parts of an image.  It's a sanity check for sky
                          subtraction scripts, and uses many of the same
                          routines as sky_calibration.
file_check.pro          Stand-alone diagnostic.  It simply checks to see which
                          files are missing.  Created after the old hard drive
                          went kablooie.
header_test.pro         Stand-alone diagnostic.  It opens every header, which
                          would give an EXTENSION error if the file was corrupt
imf_norm.pro            Stand-alone program.  Given an IMF's numbers, find
                          the distribution of stellar masses.
makeplot.pro		A stand-alone program that creates four plots for the
                          user: an RA-DEC plot in an Aitoff projection, a
                          lat-lon plot in an Aitoff projection, a histogram of
                          RA distribution, and a radial velocity vs. HI mass
                          plot.  This is supposed to be run on an entire data
                          set, not just one run.
makeplot2.pro           A stand-alone program that creates six plots for the
                          user: Seeing, photqual, skylev, skysig, skysigbx, and
                          magzpt1.
makeplot_db.pro         A stand-alone program that creates one of 10 plots.  If
                          want to know which ones open the file; it's a lot.
masshist.pro            Stand-alone program plotting mass histograms.
medhdr.pro, medhdrval.pro, medhdrval_init.pro are outside routines to be used
                          in the construction of a better DB system.
object_fix.pro          A stand-alone utility script that replaces the OBJECT
                          keyword in all .fits files in the directory with a
                          user-specified value.
patch_header.pro	A stand-alone utility script that copies certain items
                          from the header of one image into the header of 
                          another.  Don't use this unless you really know what
                          you're doing.
patch_phot.pro          Stand-alone utility script that copies the PHOTFLUX
                          information from the database into an image.
redo_radec.pro          Stand-alone that runs fix_radec on everything in a run
run1_setup.pro          Stand-alone that dumps the IRAF commands needed to 
                          process a run into a text file.
sigplot.pro		A simple stand-alone script.  For a specified galaxy,
                          create a plot of sky uncertainty as a function of 
                          the box size used in box2boxbg2.
temp_imfplot.pro        Stand-alone plot, making IMF plot.
temp_madau.pro          Stand-alone plot, making Madau plot.
temp_mass.pro           Stand-alone plot, making mass histogram.
test_header.pro         Compares the header contents to the database.
tremonti.pro            Stand-alone plot, makes the two Tremonti plots.
