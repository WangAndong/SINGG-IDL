IDL_instructions.txt	Step-by-step instructions, explaining how to use IDL to
                          combine flat-corrected object images, correct for 
                          sky, calculate flux, and all that other fun stuff.
index.txt		This file.  Duh.

IDL
aitoff_galactic.pro	On an Aitoff projection (created by routines aitoff.pro
                          and aitoff_grid.pro), create dotted grid lines 
                          corresponding to galactic latitude/longitude.
bindata.pro		Called by sky_calibration.  Given an array of box data,
                          sort each point into a histogram distribution in Z
                          (the ellipse-projection radius).  This is then used
                          to calculate the radial distribution of sky level
                          needed to determine the "edge" of a galaxy.
box2boxbg2.pro		Called by sky_calibration, this is an alternate form of
                          the box2boxbg routine.  The differences: num_boxes is
                          now passed out as an optional output argument, and
                          reject_frac is a new input argument.  If reject_frac
                          is 0.01, for example, a box will only be rejected if 
                          more than 1% of the pixels within are masked or bad.
                          Also, it uses the mysky function instead of sky, so
                          that the mask can be applied to the image.
box_sky.pro             Called by sky_calibration.  Creates the array of box data
                          (x,y,flux) needed by calc_box_sky.
build_header_db.pro     Program with parses the headers and stores its values
                          in a single IDL database
build_ref_db.pro        Program which parses the HIPASS data file and stores its values
                          in a single IDL database
build_source_db.pro     Program used to parse the various flux .profile outputs and
                          store the results in a single IDL database
calc_box_sky.pro	Called by sky_calibration and ssflux.  Given an array
                          of box data (x,y,flux) and a mask, determine the sky level.
calc_growth.pro		Called by ssflux.  This takes the pixel-by-pixel image
                          and sorts each point into a histogram distribution
                          in Z (the ellipse-projection radius).  Once all of 
                          the data points have been sorted into bins, correct
                          for masked or rejected pixels and smooth the radial
                          boundaries.
calc_mdiff.pro		Given two .stars files, find the average magnitude 
                          difference for all corresponding stars.  This is used
                          in several different places inside singg_combine,
                          most notably as part of the refflux algorithm.
calc_seeing.pro		Given a .stars file, find the average FWHM of every
                          star in the image.  This gives us the seeing of the
                          image, approximately.
calc_sfd0.pro           Primary routine.  Uses the values stored in the flux 
                          database to calculate the local star formation density.
calc_z.pro		Given the center, axial ratio, and angle of an ellipse,
                          calculate the "Z" value for a given point.  Z equals 
                          the equivalent semimajor axis of an ellipse with
                          those numbers that intersects the given point,
                          divided by the true semimajor axis of the ellipse.
cr_weight.pro		Alternate version of cr_reject with added functionality
                          for weighting arrays.  An optional argument named
                          "weight_array" allows for a single weighting per raw
                          image, to be used instead of the calculated pixel-by-
                          pixel weighting cr_reject uses.
create_struct2.pro      Variant of create_struct.  The only difference is that it adds
                          the hyphen ("-") to the list of protected symbols, so that
                          names like "DATE-OBS" can be used as variable names.
dbbuildstruct.pro       Variant of dbbuild, replacing the hard-coded 30 arrays with
                          a standard IDL structure of indefinite size.
dbplothist.pro          Called by makeplot_db.  Given a keyword, it extracts all
                          corresponding values from the SINGG database for a plot.
define_ellipse.pro	Called by sky_calibration.  Given the points stored in
                          the ellipse file (A,B,C,G), calculate the isophote
                          center (D), and the endpoints of the minor axis (E,F)
find_end_time.pro	Called by singg_combine.  Given arrays of the start
                          times and exposure times for a set of images, return
                          the end time of the final image.
find_middle.pro         Called by make_catalog.  Given a list of input *sh.fits
                          images, this uses the RA and DEC keywords in the 
                          corresponding obj????.fits images to figure out which
                          image is closest to the middle.
findzero.pro		Simple utility routine, used to find where an array
                          crosses zero.  Currently, this is only used to find
                          half-light radius as part of the ssflux algorithm.
fix_radec.pro		Called by singg_combine.  Given three headers (one for
                          each combined image), replace the rough RA and DEC
                          estimates in the header with more exact values from
                          the WCStan.pl script.
fluxcal_singg.pro	For all images within a given run, add the flux
                          calibration keywords to a header.  The most important
                          of these are PHOTFLAM/PHOTFLUX (unit response), which
                          allow the algorithm to convert from the input DN/sec
                          to more useful units (erg/cm^2/Angstrom/sec)
fluxlist.pro		Creates the two list files, runXX.lis and runXX_net.lis
                          used by the singg_fluxcal algorithm.  Note that these
                          files will all be created in the filtcoef directory,
                          not in a directory unique to a single run.
                          Also, the user is required to edit the _net.lis file
                          to use the longer names for the _filtcoef.dat files.
growth_profile.pro	Called by ssflux.  This takes the data calculated in
                          calc_growth and outputs all relevant information to a
                          profile file.  The top section contains all of the 
                          summary information: total flux, sky level, radius.
                          The bottom section is a large data table giving the
                          relevant information for each data bin.
halflight.pro		Called inside ssflux by plot_fluxcurve, this calculates
                          the half-light radius for an array of data.
hdr_template.pro	Given an input header and the name of a template file,
                          filter one through the other to get an output header.
                          The output header will have only those lines present
                          in the template, and in the order listed there.
header_fix_all.pro	Wrapper for header_fix_all, called by iraf_combine.
                          This performs the header_fix operation on all images
                          within a run.
header_fix.pro		Copy the entire contents of one header into another.
                          This is needed because the IRAF combine doesn't add
                          certain keywords to the header, which causes
                          runalard.pl (the script which makes the subtracted
                          image) to make a blank header in its output.
iraf_combine.pro	An IDL script that uses many of the same intermediate
                          algorithms as singg_combine, but replaces the actual
                          processing step with an IRAF combine.  Unlike the IDL
                          scripts, user participation is required.
irafsetup.pro		Called by iraf_combine.  This routine creates the text
                          file whose contents must be copied into an IRAF
                          session running in the same directory. 
make_catalog.pro	Creates the "runXX.catalog" file for a given run.  Once
                          this has been run the user should manually adjust the
                          "reference number" column to match the positionally
                          center R image instead of the numerically center one.
make_dummy_mask.pro	Stand-alone routine that takes the "basic_mask.fits"
                          image and adds extra masked columns hard-coded
                          internally.  To use this, change the masked areas
                          and run it once.
make_ellipse.pro	Creates the ellipse file for a given galaxy.  This
                          should be run after the J*_R.fits file has been made,
                          unless the user wants to specify a reference image
                          explicitly.
mask_ellipse_ann3.pro	Called by sky_calibration, this a variation of the old
		          mask_ellipse_ann2.  The only actual change is that
                          since adxy returns arrays for x0 and y0, calls to
                          dist_ellipse explicitly specify element [0] of these.
minibox.pro		Simple routine used inside ssflux, returning a 28" box
                          flux around the brightness peak.
mmm2.pro		A modified version of the standard MMM routine.
                          First, we move maxiter from 30 to 100, and if maxiter
                          is exceeded it doesn't set sigma to -1 or print the
                          error message, using the value of the last iteration.
                          Then, we also changed many internal variables to be
                          double-precision, to keep it from crashing when the
                          input image includes cosmic rays (any pixel with a
                          value of order 10^6).
mysky.pro		A somewhat modified version of the standard SKY routine
                          that increases maxsky (the maximum number of pixels
                          used in the calculation) from 4000 to 32768, and more
                          importantly, allows a mask to be passed in as an
                          argument.  Finally, it uses MMM2 instead of MMM.
plot_fluxcurve.pro	Called by ssflux.  This does the 3-image plot of total
                          galaxy flux as a function of ellipse-curved radius,
                          which the user needs to determine the "edge" of the
                          galaxy.
plot_skydist.pro	Called by sky_calibration.  This does the 3-image plot
                          of sky level as a function of ellipse-curved radius,
                          which the user needs to determine the "edge" of the
                          galaxy.
read_header.pro		A simple pre-existing script used by the sigplot
                          algorithm, to read the values for four keywords from
                          the header of an image.
refflux.pro		Called by singg_cr as part of the singg_combine tree.
                          Given a set of input images, this routine compares
                          the sextracted .stars files to calculate the ratio
                          of fluxes for objects in each image.  These ratios
                          are needed by cr_weight to correct each image to 
                          comparable intensities.
run_combine.pro		Wrapper for singg_combine, combines object images for 
                          all galaxies within a given run.
run_ellipse.pro		Wrapper for make_ellipse, creates ellipse files for all
                          galaxies within a given run.
run_flux.pro		Wrapper for ssflux, creates curves of growth for all 
                          galaxies within a given run.
run_sky.pro		Wrapper for sky_calibration, calculates sky levels and
                          subtracts for all galaxies within a given run.
show_cube.pro		A test routine, allowing the user to see the contents
                          of a 3D array.
show_mask.pro		A test routine, allowing the user to see the contents
                          of a 2D array.
singg_combine.pro	Primary routine.  For the current galaxy, this script
                          combines the object images into three composite
                          images (R, narrow-band, subtracted).  It uses
                          cr_weight (above) as its primary combine routine, but
                          with a dynamic scaling to correct for sky levels and 
                          poor visibility.
singg_copy_wcs.pro	Copy the WCS information from one header to another.
                          Used by singg_combine to fix the _Rsub header.
singg_cr.pro		Called by singg_combine.  This is the mid-level routine
                          that sets up the image combining.  It creates the 
                          memory-intensive data cubes needed by cr_weight, runs
                          refflux and singg_mask_cube, and runs cr_weight.
singg_filtnam.pro	Given a filter name, match it to the "official" names
                          within a given 2D array (output from rdfiltfile)
singg_header.pro	Called by singg_combine.  This routine adds all of the
                          new information to the combined-image headers before
                          writing the new .fits files.
singg_mask_cube.pro	Called by singg_cr as part of the singg_combine tree.
                          This routine creates a mask cube, masking for several
                          different factors, including saturation and negative
                          pixel values.
singg_photcal.pro	A stand-alone one-time script, run in the STD directory
                          once the images there have been calibrated by 
                          algorithms run by other people.
singg_rdfiltfile.pro	Reads the standard filter definition file, creating a
                          2D array filled with alternate names for each filter.
singg_setup.pro		A one-time script, which creates and configures the
                          directory tree for a new run of data.
sky_cal_single.pro      Variant of sky_calibration that only processes one specific
                          image.  Useful when an _Rsub_ss got corrupted.  None of
                          the advanced options (such as the interactive mode) are
                          available.
sky_calibration.pro	Primary routine.  For the current galaxy, this script
                          calculates the sky level for each combined image 
                          using a 35x35 box algorithm and heavy masking.  The
                          images are then corrected for these sky levels. 
srcor2.pro		A slightly-modified version of SRCOR.  A "/silent"
                          keyword was added, allowing the user to turn off all
                          of the message commands.  Because I wanted to.
ssflux.pro		Primary routine.  For the current galaxy, this script
                          creates curves of growth for all three skysub'd
                          images, for two separate methods (brightness peak vs
                          isophote center).  The user must select an "edge 
                          radius", representing the flux of the entire object.
                          It then creates various data outputs.
thing1.pro		Called by iraf_combine, thing1 consists of all of the
                          steps that are performed BEFORE the user copies the
                          commands into the IRAF window.
thing2.pro		Called by iraf_combine, thing2 consists of all of the
                          steps that are performed AFTER the user copies the
                          commands into the IRAF window.
trim_stars.pro          Called by singg_combine, this removes any stars located 
                          within (buffer) of the edge from the .stars files.
write_ssfits.pro	Called by sky_calibration, this creates the subtracted
                          .fits images after adding all new variables to the
                          header.

Other
imregister_mine.pl	A variant of imregister_new.pl, with the addition of 
                          two mask arguments: maskin and maskout.  Basically it
                          will take maskin and run it through the same
                          convolution it performs on the object images.  Also,
                          the convolution uses sinc7 interpolation instead of
                          linear.
