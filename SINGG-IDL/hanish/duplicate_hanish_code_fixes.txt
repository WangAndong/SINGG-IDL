Here is what I did with the hanish IDL programs that that had duplicate
names to mine.

G. Meurer 28.09.2007

create_struct2.pro 
  + essentially identical to my version 
  + rm & cvs remove from hanish :
  + cvs commit 

dbbuildstruct.pro
  + this looks pretty different from my version.  
  + but call procedure looks the same
  + probably will adopt Dan's version
  + rename my version (in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgdb) to dbbuildstruct_old.pro
  + make comment in header section
  + copy Dan's version into ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgdb
  + cvs commit (singgdb)
  + in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/hanish:
    - rm , cvs remove, and cvs commit

good_derived.pro
  + identical to version in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgdb
  + rm & cvs remove from hanish :
  + cvs commit 

hdr_template.pro
  + modified by Dan from my version.
  + since my version is not under cvs, just rename it
  + in IDL/Pro/SINGG_old
  + mv hdr_template.pro hdr_template_old.pro

pfplt_extractprof.pro
  + looks like Dan has made a significant change
  + mine is under CVS, but I don't have a directory for it under
    ~/IDL/Pro/Work.  So this will take a bit of effort...
  + in ~/IDL/Pro/SINGG/Profileplot
  + cvs commit  (changes were not checked in...)
  + cd .. ; cvs release -d Profileplot 
  + cvs export -d Profileplot -D 12/31/2007 idlpro/singgprof  
    (now have uptodate version without CVS directory...)
  + cd ~/IDL/Pro/Work
  + cvs checkout -d singgprof idlpro/singgprof
  + cd singgprof
  + cp pfplt_extractprof.pro pfplt_extractprof_old2.pro
  + cp ../hanish/pfplt_extractprof.pro .
  + add comment to history section
  + cvs add pfplt_extractprof_old2.pro
  + cvs commit ...
  + in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/hanish
    - rm , cvs remove, and cvs commit 

readcol_new.pro
  + my version is different, but I don't use it, and it is not under CVS
  + so rename my version (in ~/IDL/Pro) to readcol_grm.pro

release_write_hdr.pro
  + looks like Dan has made an improvement
  + rename my version (in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgrel) to
    release_write_hdr_grm.pro
  + cp ~/IDL/Pro/Work/hanish/release_write_hdr.pro 
  + added a comment about Dan's mod to history line
  + cvs commit (singgrel)
  + in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/hanish:
    - rm , cvs remove, and cvs commit

setplotcolors.pro
  + significantly different from my version
  + rename hanish version setplotcolors_hanish.pro
  + cvs remove setplotcolors.pro  ; cvs add setplotcolors_hanish.pro

singg_filtnam.pro
  + looks like the main difference is that Dan added a /silent option
  + rename my version (in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgfilt/) to
    singg_filtnam_old.pro
  + added a comment to history section
  + copy Dan's version to ~/IDL/Pro/Work/singgfilt/
  + add comment to history section re silent option
  + cvs commit singgfilt
  + in ~/IDL/Pro/Work/hanish:
    - rm , cvs remove, and cvs commit

singg_pagebot.pro
  + Dan's modification are very Dan specific and only used in singg_qa.pro
  + rename hanish version to hanish_pagebot.pro
  + added some comments...
  + changed calls in singg_qa
  + cvs remove singg_pagebot.pro
  + cvs add hanish_pagebot.pro 
  + cvs commit ...
