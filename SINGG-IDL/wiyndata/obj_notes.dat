obj01010023_0025    # The detected velocities are too scattered, and the rotation too weak, to obtain a good fit.
obj01010026_0029    # The detected velocities are too scattered, and the rotation too weak, to obtain a good fit.
obj01010030_0032    # The rotation curve fit is of poor quality, with uncertainties in the rotation velocities larger than the velocities themselves.  This is due to the observed velocities being very low and having large scatter.
obj01010034_0036    # The rotation curve fit has large residuals.  This could be related to the asymmetry that can be seen in the image, suggesting that the simple model used may be insufficient to describe the galaxy.
obj01010037_0039    # This galaxy has a large central region with very little velocity structure, giving a low gradient to the rotation curve.  At large radii the rotation velocity increases greatly.
obj01020094_0096    # The rotation curve fit is very good, with low residuals and low uncertainties.  However the rotation curve shows a sharp peak at a radius of 5 arcseconds, which may be due to noise rather than the actual structure of the galaxy.  Note that at large inclinations the 5-arcsecond ring covers a very small area of the sky.
obj01020097_0099    # It is clear that the center of the galaxy is not close to the center of the aperture array, so the x- and y-positions were set to be unconstrained when fitting the rotation curve.  It is not certain that the fitting procedure found the true center of the galaxy, but a fit was found with reasonable residuals and uncertainties.
obj01020101_0103    # The small number of data points available, and their proximity to the center, resulted in very large uncertainties on all the parameters of the fit.
obj01020104_0107    # There is a good rotation curve fit for this galaxy, with very small residuals, but it shows an unexpected dip in the velocity at a radius of 30 arcseconds.  The quality of the fit may be due in part to emission lines being seen over a large area of sky but in relatively few apertures, limiting the number of data points the fit must reproduce.
obj02010039_0041    # The rotation curve fit is reasonably good in terms of the size of the residuals, but the uncertainties on the velocities are quite high and the rotation curve has an unexpected shape, dropping to zero at 10 arcseconds.
obj02010042_0044    # No structure in the velocity could be seen in this galaxy, so a rotation curve fit could not be performed.
obj02020071_0073    # This galaxy has many of the desired properties for deriving a rotation curve: intermediate inclination, large spatial extent, and reasonably large fluxes.  As such it produced a good rotation curve fit, with low uncertainties and residuals.
obj02020082_0084    # The rotation curve fit to this galaxy is mostly very good, except at low radii (up to 10 arcseconds) there are very large errors on the rotation velocity.
obj02020086_0088    # The rotation curve fit to this galaxy is poor, with large residuals and uncertainties.  This may indicate that the spiral arms make the simple model used inappropriate.
obj02020090_0092    # The velocity structure of this galaxy is too weak to fit a rotation curve.
obj02020096_0097    # The low inclination of this galaxy produces a degeneracy where multiplying the inclination and the rotation velocities by the same factor has little effect on the observed velocity field.  As a result there are large uncertainties on the inclination and velocities.  This galaxy was observed again in 2006 (filenumber 03010042_0043).  The two fits generally agree within the quoted uncertainties.
obj03010031_0033    # The rotation curve fit to this galaxy has low residuals, due in part to the small number of data points to be reproduced.  The velocity uncertainties are low but the fitting procedure had difficulty finding the position, position angle and inclination.  This resulted in larger uncertainties for these parameters, and the x-position reached the edge of the allowed region I had set.
obj03010034_0036    # No structure in the velocity could be seen in this galaxy, so a rotation curve fit could not be performed.
obj03010039_0041    # This galaxy produced a good rotation curve fit, with low uncertainties and reasonable residuals.
obj03010042_0043    # The low inclination of this galaxy produces a degeneracy where multiplying the inclination and the rotation velocities by the same factor has little effect on the observed velocity field.  As a result there are large uncertainties on the inclination and velocities.  This galaxy was observed previously in 2005 (filenumber 02020096_0097).  The two fits generally agree within the quoted uncertainties.
obj03020074_0076    # This galaxy produced a good rotation curve fit, with low uncertainties and residuals.
obj03020079_0082    # This galaxy produced a good rotation curve fit, with low uncertainties and residuals.  The rotational velocities are unusually low.
