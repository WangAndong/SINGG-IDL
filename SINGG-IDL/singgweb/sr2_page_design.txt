1. Object name

2. Summary table (from singg_derived, singg_derived_sr1, proc3_header)
   + version (SR1, SR2)
   + file names (Rsub, nb, cont)
   + Object name
   + RA, DEC
   + Log(Halpha flux)
   + m_R
   + PA, a/b
   + R_max
   + R_e
   + seeing
   + airmass
   * Should probably make this table separately 

For each *sub_ss.fits file

3. SR2 3 color    4. Finder chart
   image with 	     with numbers
   aps

5. table with numbers in item 3
   and corresponding source names

6. Thumbnails of sqrt, lin, and log images
   put in a row linked to full images.

(7. Gray scale images of R, NB, net images
    thumbnails linked to full images
    + ds9 command line that will display all images)

(8. thumbnails and links to predecessor images)

(9. Inclusion mask* sqrt images, 
    one for each source.)

(10. Radial profiles)

(11. SE catalog CMD
     Use color + S/N cut to identify likely 
     Halpha sources.)

METHOD

* Use proc3_header_database as driver

* get unique target names

* Loop through target names

  * Gather (or derive) info needed to make SR2 web page
    + name of 3 color image with aps
    + name of other three color images
    + name of finder chart
    + name of object table
    + directory to make to put all results
    + run id
    + NB filter
    + continuum filter
  
  * routine to make web page
    + make directory (nuke if already there), enter it
    + link images
    + open page
    + write html header
    + format table
    + write rest of page
    + footer with creation date
    + link page to index.html for that directory
