surfprofgen_test.pro = Ji Hoon's Test program for making uniformly
masked surface brightness profiles and comparing them to the single band
surface brightness profiles.

It calls the following procedures
* calc_growth.pro : Dan Hanish's code to generate enclosed flux and
  surface brightness profiles.
* read_profile_header.pro : Dan Hanish's code to read the header of a
  profile ascii file and store the info in an IDL data structure.
* pfplt_extractprof.pro : My code to extract a surface brightness
  profile and header information from a surface brightness profile ascii
  file made with Dan's code.
* fits_read.pro : ASTROLIB code to read fits iamge and header
* xyad.pro : ASTROLIB code to convert pixel -> sky coords
* adxy.pro : ASTROLIB code to convert sky -> pixel coords
* restore.pro : restores an IDL session.

Comments
* This code starts with the images and masks _after_ being convolved to
  a common seeing.
  + Need to get Ji Hoon's code for doing that...
* It seems to only use the R and Halpha masks to make a common mask.
