SSOUP Programming Things To Do
------------------------------

* Reintegrate dust corrected surface brightness profiles to get dust
  corrected aperture fluxes.  [SSOUP_CALPROF.PRO]
  # Done 5/2011

* Calculate flux/surface brightness upper limits. 
  + ideally the Halpha error model will be fixed ...

* Halpha/FUV plot improvements
  + indicate upper limits 
    [SSOUP_CALPROF.PRO, SSOUP_PLOTHAFUV.PRO, SSOUP_MULTI_PLOTHAFUV.PRO]
    # Done 5/2011
  + indicate integrated fluxes 
  + have a set minimum delta-r, and/or delta-L(FUV)
    - minimum delta-r set by seeing currently
    - want to avoid the case where ring size is smaller than size of HII
      regions. 
    - Also want to avoid case where there is likely to be less than 1 O
      star in ring (this can be set by having a minimum delta-L_FUV).

* Stand alone or initial SExtractor pipeline
  + SE input file band dependent

* Stand alone or initial moment analysis pipeline
  + gives approx isophote shapes

* Stand alone mask tool
  + maybe get from ZZ

* Stand alone ap adjustment tool
  + would require ap parameters to be allowed to be set in parameter
    file, or some other override from DB values
  + Maybe start with Hanish code
  + Draw radial profiles of SB from boxes
  + allow user to enter new skyord
    - show effect on radial profiles, 3 color images
    - autoimated minimisation of sky order

* Allow new sky models
  + skymod_<band> = poly (current default)
  + skymod_<band> = radial (polynomial in radius, will need im center)
  + skymod_<band> = mixed (polynomials in both radius and cartesian,
                           careful of degenericies...)

* Improve handling of multiple galaxies
  + consistent masking when calculating sky
  + separate plots for each galaxy

* Write out model FIR surface brightness and enclosed flux profile
  [SSOUP_CALPROF.PRO] 
  + calculate modeled FIR flux.

* Make plots of enclosed quantities (with and without dust correction)
  + fluxes/mag (FUV, NUV, R, Halpha)
  + color (FUV-NUV, NUV-R, EW(Halpha), Halpha/FUV)
  + calculate and show R_20, R_80: radii containing 20% and 80% of fluxes

* Improve the error models in the Halpha profiles.
  + need to account for error in the continuum subtraction

* Model fits to surface brightness profiles
  + kron radius, aperture, fluxes
  + exponential fit
  + sersic profile fit

* Make QA plots for the sky fitting
  + show measurements in boxes
    # Done 8/2012
  + show model in boxes 
    # Done 8/2012
  + show residuals in boxes
    # Done 8/2012
  + overlay apertures
  + overlay masks
  + show rejected boxes

* Put input parameters in a structure
  - this will make it easier to add parameters

* Save results for each galaxy as an IDL saveset?
  - stores at machine accuracy...

* Compile results to a database (IDL, or SQL?)

* Generalize to add other bands
  + most likely add-ons
    - WISE mid-IR four bands
    - Pan-STARRS1, grizy 5 bands
    - POGS stellar mass maps, SF maps
  + Needs to work whether or not bands are there

* Put it in to SVN or GitHub

* Stand-alone (probably) pipeline for 2D modelling (Galfit)
