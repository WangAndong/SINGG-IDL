# The following gives:

#
#  1 sma    = semi major axis [arcsec]
#  2 mu_R   = R band surface brightness [ABmag arcsec^-2]
#  3 err    = error in mu_R (column 2) [mag]
#  4 lSHa   = log10(Halpha Surface brightness [erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2])
#  5 etot   = total error in LSHa (column 4) [dex]
#  6 esky   = contribution to error on LSHa (column 4) from photon statitistics and sky [dex]
#  7 ecnt   = contribution to error on LSHa (column 4) from continuum subtraction [dex]
#  8 mu_nuv = NUV band surface brightness [ABmag arcsec^-2]
#  9 err    = error on mu_nuv (column 8) [mag]
# 10 mu_fuv = FUV band surface brightness [ABmag arcsec^-2]
# 11 err    = error on mu_fuv (column 8) [mag]

# 16 lHa/R  = log(SHa / surface brightness in R) [log(Angstroms)]

#
# The following "magic values" are used
#   9.999 in a surface brightness error column (columns 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11)
#         means the value is an upper limit to the linear surface brightness. 
#   9.999 in an error to surface color or equivalent width (columns 13, 15, 17, 19)
#         means that the quantities in bothe numerator and denominator are 
#         undetected and therefore the surface color or equivalent width is undefined.
# -99.999 in a surface color or equivalent width column (12, 14, 16, 18) marks 
#         an undefined quantity (see above).
#   7.777 indicates that the preceding surface color or equivalent width is
#         a lower limit
#   8.888 indicates that the preceding surface color or equivalent width is 
#         an upper limit
